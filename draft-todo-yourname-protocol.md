--- abstract

This paper 6
concentrates on designing an emulation platform which provides a realistic, flexible, and extensible 7
experimental environment for the SN. The architecture of platform includes four components, namely 8
logical plane, control plane, data plane and measurement plane. Container technology is adopted to 9
flexibly symbolize network nodes. The emulation method of dynamic connection relationships and 10
time-varying link characteristics between pairwise nodes are considered so as to realize the real space 11
environment and arbitrary topology. Furthermore, an extensible structure is described to emulate 12
large-scale scenarios and access external emulation resources.
